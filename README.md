# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio & Knowledge Base

## 👋 About This Repository
Welcome to my centralized cybersecurity portfolio. This repository serves as a living documentation of my journey through the **TryHackMe Pre-Security Certification** and my transition into Cybersecurity Architecture.

Here, I translate theoretical concepts into practical documentation, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and security analysis. My goal is to build a "Second Brain" for security operations, documenting the "Why" and "How" behind core technologies.
