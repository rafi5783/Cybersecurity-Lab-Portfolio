# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio & Knowledge Base

## 👋 About This Repository
Welcome to my centralized cybersecurity portfolio. This repository serves as a living documentation of my journey through the **TryHackMe Pre-Security Certification** and my transition into Cybersecurity Architecture.

Here, I translate theoretical concepts into practical documentation, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and security analysis. My goal is to build a "Second Brain" for security operations, documenting the "Why" and "How" behind core technologies.

## 📂 Portfolio Modules

### 1. 🌐 [Network Fundamentals](./01_Network_Fundamentals)
*Analysis of how data moves, breaks, and can be secured.*
* **The OSI Model:** Deep dive into the 7 layers of abstraction and associated attacks.
* **Port Management:** A reference for identifying services and potential entry points.
* **Tooling:** Operational guide for `ping`, `traceroute`, and basic connectivity analysis.

### 2. 🌍 [Web Fundamentals](./02_How_The_Web_Works)

   Analysis of the core architecture of the internet and web application security.
   * **How The Web Works:** Breakdown of the Client-Server model and Request-Response cycle.
   * **DNS & HTTP:** Deep dive into status codes, headers, and record types.
   * **Session Management:** Analysis of Cookies and stateless protocols.
   * **Common Exploits:** Introduction to SQLi, XSS, and IDOR vulnerabilities.

### 3. 🐧 [Linux Fundamentals](./03_Linux_Fundamentals)

Operational analysis of the Linux Operating System, Shell interaction, and system administration.
- **The File System:** Navigation of the Logical File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
- **Permissions & Users:** Deep dive into users, groups, `sudo` privileges, and file modes (`chmod`/`chown`).
- **Process Management:** Analysis of running services, PIDs, and background processes.
- **Shell Scripting:** Automation basics using Bash variables, loops, and logic.

### 4. 🪟 [Windows Fundamentals](./04_Windows_Fundamentals)

Operational analysis of the Windows Operating System, core architecture, and administrative tools.
* **File System & Permissions:** Deep dive into NTFS structure, DACLs, and Alternate Data Streams (ADS).
* **The Registry:** Anatomy of system configuration, hives, keys, and persistence mechanisms.
* **Processes & Services:** Analysis of the Service Control Manager, Task Manager, and identifying malicious processes.
* **PowerShell & CLI:** Command-line administration using CMD and PowerShell cmdlets.

### 5. ⌨️ [Command Line](./05_Command_Line)

Operational analysis of command-line interfaces (CLI) for system administration and automation across platforms.
* **Windows & PowerShell:** Deep dive into OS management using legacy CMD commands and modern PowerShell object-based cmdlets.
* **Linux Shell:** Operational analysis of the Bash shell, covering file system navigation, permission management (`chmod`), and text processing (`grep`).
* **Scripting & Automation:** Basics of writing shell scripts and using pipes (`|`) to chain commands for efficient workflow automation.

### 6. 🌐 [Networking](./06_Networking)

Operational analysis of network architecture, protocols, and data transmission models.
* **OSI & TCP/IP Models:** Comparative analysis of the 7-layer ISO theoretical framework versus the practical DoD TCP/IP stack.
* **IP Addressing:** Deep dive into IPv4 structure, CIDR subnetting mechanics, and RFC 1918 private address ranges.
* **Transport Layer:** Examination of reliable, connection-oriented communication (TCP/3-way handshake) versus connectionless speed (UDP).
* **Encapsulation:** Analysis of the data lifecycle and header addition process from Application data to Physical frames.
* **Routing & Tools:** Layer 3 routing logic and utilizing CLI tools (Telnet, ipconfig) for service discovery and diagnostics.

*(More modules on Web Fundamentals and Linux Security coming soon...)*
